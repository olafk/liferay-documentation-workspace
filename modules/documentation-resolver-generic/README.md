# Generic Documentation Resolver

This plugin serves as a last resort - if you really want to: For any generic WidgetPage or ContentPage, it provides a hardcoded audioguide and documentation. If you have more specific information for any other page, make sure that
you deploy another DocumentationResolver with higher priority to preempt this one.

Or, if you really don't want generic audioguides for Widget- and Content-Pages: Undeploy this plugin.
