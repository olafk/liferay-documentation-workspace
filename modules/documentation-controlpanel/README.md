# ControlPanel documentation

This plugin utilizes the infrastructure from the [ControlPanelDocumentation](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/170064253) plugin to show documentation links and audioguides in controlpanel.

It won't show `video` or `youtube` media, but it will show `audio`.
On top, it adds `audioguide` capabilities. Note that the audioguide script embedds the audio URL together with the illustration steps.
